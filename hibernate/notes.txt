Two types of access

Field based and property based

Annotations can be applied on field or getters
Default is field based

If @Id is present on field then entire class is field based else its property based

It can be explicitly mentioned using @Access(AccessType.FIELD)

for property mention AccessType.PROPERTY
still we can assign FIELD to select variables

ex:

@Acess(AccessType.FIELD)
class Passenger {
@Id
private int id

@Access(AccessType.PROPERTY)
public String getName() {
    return name;
}
}

field based: easy to read, no need to expore getters

primary key:
simple or composite

rule for composite
public, no args constr, serializable, override equals and hashcode


genratedvalue is only for simple primary key
can be applied to field or property
